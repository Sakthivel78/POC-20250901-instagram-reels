Sleep Myths You Should Stop Believing:

Think you know the truth about sleep? Well… some of the most common ‘facts’ about sleep are actually myths that might be ruining your rest.

1.Myth one: ‘You can catch up on sleep during weekends.’ Sadly, no. Sleeping extra doesn’t fully undo the effects of chronic sleep deprivation.
 Your body works best with a consistent routine.

2.Myth two: ‘Everyone needs 8 hours of sleep.’ Not true for all. Some people feel refreshed with 7, others need 9. Quality matters as much
 as quantity.

3.Myth three: ‘Alcohol helps you sleep better.’ While alcohol may knock you out quickly, it disrupts deep sleep cycles, 
leaving you groggy the next morning.

4.Myth four: ‘If you wake up at night, you’re unhealthy.’ Waking briefly during the night is normal.
As long as you fall back asleep quickly, it’s not a problem.

Better sleep comes from facts, not myths. Share this with a friend who still believes these sleep myths—and help them rest easier!
