Health Myths You Should Stop Believing

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:05,000
You’ve probably heard health tips from friends or family…

3
00:00:05,001 --> 00:00:09,000
But some are flat-out myths that could harm more than help.

4
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13,000
Myth one: “You need to drink 8 glasses of water daily.”

5
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:19,000
The truth? Your body’s needs vary by activity, climate, and diet.

6
00:00:19,001 --> 00:00:22,000
Listen to your thirst, not a fixed number.

7
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:27,000
Myth two: “Carbs make you fat.” Not true!

8
00:00:27,001 --> 00:00:32,000
Whole grains, fruits, and legumes are healthy carbs
packed with fiber and energy.

9
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:36,000
It’s excess refined carbs and sugars that lead to weight gain.

10
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:41,000
Myth three: “Cracking your knuckles causes arthritis.” Relax!

11
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:46,000
Studies show no direct link.
At worst, you might just annoy people.

11
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:49,000
But it doesn’t damage your joints.

12
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:52,000
Myth four: “Detox juices cleanse your body.”

13
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:56,000
Your liver and kidneys are your real detox machines.

14
00:00:56,001 --> 00:00:58,000
No expensive juice is required.

15
00:00:58,001 --> 00:01:00,000
Stop letting health myths control your life.


16
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:06,000
Follow facts, not fads.
