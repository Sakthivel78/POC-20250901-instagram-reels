Sleep Myths You Should Stop Believing

2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:07,000
Think you know the truth about sleep?
Some “facts” are actually myths.

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:09,000
They might be ruining your rest.

4
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13,000
Myth one: “You can catch up on sleep during weekends.”

5
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:18,000
Sadly, no. Extra sleep can’t undo chronic sleep deprivation.

6
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:22,000
Your body works best with a consistent routine.

7
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:25,000
Myth two: “Everyone needs 8 hours of sleep.”

8
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:31,000
Not true for all. Some feel refreshed with 7, others need 9.

9
00:00:31,001 --> 00:00:33,000
Quality matters as much as quantity.

10
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:37,000
Myth three: “Alcohol helps you sleep better.”

11
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:41,000
Alcohol may knock you out, but it disrupts deep sleep.

12
00:00:41,001 --> 00:00:43,000
You wake groggy the next morning.

13
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:47,000
Myth four: “If you wake up at night, you’re unhealthy.”

14
00:00:47,001 --> 00:00:52,000
Waking briefly is normal—if you fall back asleep quickly.

15
00:00:52,001 --> 00:00:56,000
Better sleep comes from facts, not myths.

00:00:56,001 --> 00:01:01,000
