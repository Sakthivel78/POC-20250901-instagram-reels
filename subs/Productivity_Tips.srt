2
00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:06,000
Ever feel like the day slips away  
but your to-do list barely shrinks?

3
00:00:06,001 --> 00:00:09,000
The secret isn’t working longer—  
it’s working smarter.

4
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13,000
Let me share a few proven  
productivity tips.

5
00:00:13,001 --> 00:00:17,000
Tip one: Plan tomorrow today.  
Before ending your workday, 

6
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,000
jot down your top three priorities.

7
00:00:20,001 --> 00:00:24,000
This removes decision fatigue  
and helps you start with focus.

8
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:30,000
Tip two: Work in focused bursts.  
Try the Pomodoro Technique—25 minutes,

9
00:00:30,001 --> 00:00:33,000
followed 5 minutes brake.

10
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:36,000
These intervals keep your energy steady  
and your mind sharp.

11  
00:00:36,001 --> 00:00:42,000
Tip three: Match tasks with your energy.  
Do high-thinking work when you’re most alert.

12
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:48,000
Save routine tasks  
for low-energy hours.

13
00:00:48,001 --> 00:00:53,000
Tip four: Cut digital clutter.  
Turn off non-urgent notifications.

14
00:00:53,001 --> 00:00:59,000
Schedule specific times to check  
email or messages. Constant pings destroy focus.

15
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:02,000
Remember, productivity is about quality,  
not hours worked.

16
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:05,000
Start small—apply just one  
of these tips today.

17
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:09,000
And share this with someone  
who needs a productivity boost!
